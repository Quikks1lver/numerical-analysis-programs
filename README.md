Here's a bunch of numerical analysis/calculus programs I wrote to test and solve problems during my
numerical analysis course at UCF. As long as you have `Python3` or `Java`, you should have no
trouble giving these programs a go!

### How to Run

- `python3 Program.py` if Python program
- `javac Program.java` and `java Program` if Java program
